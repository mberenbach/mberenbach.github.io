Marc's quick manual for the body

# Philosophy

Overall goals:
1. Maximize lean body mass (muscle) and overall health
2. Minimize fat (within reason) and markers of disease 

Shooting for these goals will give you the best possible chances of staying mobile + healthy as long as possible. They also contribute positively to mental markers of health such as memory and mood.

To accomplish this, the plan itself must be practical and something you can follow over a lifetime! So the plan is:
1. Simple to implement
2. Time efficient
3. Flexible

# Plan outline

The plan has two major components:
1. Progressive resistence training
2. Nutrition

Progressive resistance training is by far the most effective, time efficient way to increase overall strength and mass. It also provides an indirect aerobic and cardiovascular effect. On the other hand, other forms of exercise (running, sports, etc) are less effective to varying degrees for this purpose. This is not to say that if you have a favorite physical activity that you shouldn't do it, but to be clear: it is not a substitute for progressive resistance training.

As far as nutrition, there is a lot of junk science out there. I have fallen prey to it over the years. Like with resistance training, there is a lot of minuteae where you can easily lose the forest for the trees. We focus only on the basics.

## Progressive resistence training

Practically speaking how do we accomplish increasing our lean mass?

Here are a list of things which, from current research, don't seem to matter much or at all:
1. Length of rest periods between sets
2. Exercise cadence (provided it's a controlled motion - no difference between a 10 second rep and a 2 second rep)
3. Going to absolute failure
4. Doing more than 1-3 sets per exercise, or doing any exercise more than 2-3 times a week.

## Nutrition

For very detailed information, please see the resources at the end.

### Food quality

1. '''Avoid''' foods that you are allergic to, cause inflammation, or generally make you feel sick. For me (and many people) this may include things like grains, lentils, nuts, dairy.
2. '''Eat''' foods that are natural and fit your macronutrient profile.

# Tiny hacks
## Long fast

Once in awhile we've overindugled, and feel - to use a technical term - "blah". On these occasions, doing a long fast (24-36 hours) can 
really help reenergize and get some digestive and mental relief. No real rules - just don't eat any solid food. I'd also recommend
drinking some coffee, tea, matcha (or some other non-sweet, non-caloric beverage) to help with focus and keeping active. If you do crave protein,
having 1-2 scoops of protein powder is probably fine, but not necessary.

## Walking

I strongly encourage moving around casually as much as you can. Not jogging, not running, just plain walking. It is not a replacement for resistance training, but it should feel pleasant, meditative, improve mood, and help recovery from more serious exercise.

In practice, park farther away from the storefront, take the stairs rather than the elevator, taking a walking 1:1 meeting rather than sitting in a conference room, etc.

## Movement and flow

As we get older, there is a tendency to feel a bit less limber. A dynamic movement of some type - could be tai chi, pilates, just doing random bodyweight moves is not a bad idea to keep the blood flowing and loosen up a bit. Of course - not to sound like a broken record again - it does not replace the progressive resistance program.

# The ultimate, super brief cliff notes:

## Exercise routine (all performed preferably with barbell, except chin-ups)
1. Squats
2. Deadlifts
3. Bench Press
4. Barbell Row
5. Overhead Press
6. Chin-ups

This hits all major muscle groups in the body. Do this twice a week on different days to start (A/B, for example A on Monday and B on Thursday), and do 3 sets of each exercise to start.

Optional (if you feel like it, these are not strictly required):
* Face pulls - especially great if you have shoulder problems
* Ab work - planks, hanging knee raises, cable crunches, etc
* Calves - standing calf raise of some kind
* Arms - bicep curls, tricep presses


# FAQ

Q: Do I really need .8g / lb LBM protein?
A: No, but I wouldn't go below .6g / lb LBM. Trying to do this program on too little protein is asking for bad recovery and spinning
your wheels. Also, as you age it seems that there is a phenomenon called "anabolic resistance" which makes it harder for your body to utilize
protein, and larger dosing has been shown to be more effective for older men and women.

Q: I'm worried about getting too (bulky/skinny/whatever)
A: You won't - it takes consistent effort over a long period to notice these changes. And I guarantee you will have a more positive self-image
during the process, because you will feel better after doing this on a consistent basis.

Q: I can lift X lbs in the squat. Is that good?
A: How much you can lift is influenced by a lot of factors - your body build type, muscle insertions, age, training history, etc. So as such,
there is only one important comparison, which is with yourself. As long as you're striving to increase or maintain to your best ability,
the absolute number is not relevant at all.

1. Calories in, calories out still rules - nobody will ever gain weight on 500 calories a day, (almost) nobody will ever lose weight on 20k calories.
2. But hormone profiles, satiation, and psychological effects are important too, and can impact the partitioning of extra food. 
3. Remember, the goal is *not* to gain or lose weight per se. It is to maximize lean body mass and health, and minimize fat (to a reasonable point) and disease markers.


2. Everything is estimated off lean bodyweight, since that is the part of your body which predominantly 'metabolically active' (muscle, bone, organ).

3. Balanced macronutrients have been demonstrated (anecdotally) to
