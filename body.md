Marc's quick manual for the body

# Philosophy

Overall goals:
1. Maximize lean body mass (muscle) and overall health
2. Minimize fat (within reason) and markers of disease 

Believe it or not, the same activities which lead to #1 and #2 also contribute positiviely to mental markers of health (memory, mood) and longevity.

To accomplish this, the plan itself must be practical and something you can follow over a lifetime! So the plan is:
1. Simple to implement
2. Time efficient
3. Flexible

# Plan outline

The plan has two major components:
1. Progressive resistence training
2. Nutrition

Progressive resistance training is by far the most effective, time efficient way to increase overall strength and mass. It also 
provides an indirect aerobic and cardiovascular effect. On the other hand, other forms of exercise (running, sports, etc) are less
effective to varying degrees for this purpose. This is not to say that if you have a favorite physical activity that you shouldn't do it,
but to be clear: it is not a substitute for progressive resistance training.

As far as nutrition, there is a lot of junk science out there. I have fallen prey to it over the years. Like with resistance training,
there is a lot of minuteae where you can easily lose the forest for the trees. We focus only on the basics.

## Progressive resistence training

Ok, so practically speaking how do we accomplish increasing our lean mass

Here are a list of things which, from current research, don't seem to matter much or at all:
1. Length of rest periods between sets
2. Exercise cadence (provided it's a controlled motion - no difference between a 10 second rep and a 2 second rep)
3. Going to absolute failure
4. Doing more than 1-3 sets per exercise, or doing any exercise more than 2-3 times a week.

# Little add-ons and hacks
## Long fast

Once in awhile we've overindugled, and feel - to use a technical term - "blah". On these occasions, doing a long fast (24-36 hours) can 
really help reenergize and get some digestive and mental relief. No real rules - just don't eat any solid food. I'd also recommend
drinking some coffee, tea, matcha (or some other non-sweet, non-caloric beverage) to help with focus and keeping active. If you do crave protein,
having 1-2 scoops of protein powder is probably fine, but not necessary.

## Walking

If you're doing the training program, technically you don't need to do this, but I strongly encourage walking as much as you can. Not jogging, 
not running, just plain walking. It has some nice small health benefits, but again it's not a replacement for the training or nutrition program.

## Movement and flow

As we get older, there is a tendency to feel a bit less limber. A dynamic movement of some type - could be tai chi, pilates, just doing random
bodyweight moves is not a bad idea to keep the blood flowing and loosen up a bit. Of course - not to sound like a broken record again - it does
not replace the progressive resistance program.

# The ultimate, super brief cliff notes:

## Exercise routine (all performed preferably with barbell, except chin-ups)
1. Squats
2. Deadlifts
3. Bench Press
4. Barbell Row
5. Overhead Press
6. Chin-ups

All performed two times a week on different days (A/B, for example A on Monday and B on Thursday)

Beginner (or abbreviated)
Day A and B: Perform 1x8-10 of each exercise, increase weight when 10 reps are achieved two workouts in a row.

Advanced (or more time to spare)
Day A - Perform 3x3-5 each exercise, increase weight once 3x5 is achieved on two consecutive weeks.
Day B - Perform 2x6-8 each exercise, increase weight once 2x8 is achieved on two consecutive weeks.

# FAQ

Q: Where is the ab work, calf work, or bicep work?
A: You don't need it (really). All of these bodyparts will get a lot of indirect work on the compound movements, and genetics will play a 
bigger role in how well these muscles will develop. However, if you really want to focus here, hanging leg raises, standing calf raises, and 
barbell curls are the most effective exercises for these bodyparts.

Q: Do I really need .8g / lb LBM protein?
A: No, but I wouldn't go below .6g / lb LBM. Trying to do this program on too little protein is asking for bad recovery and spinning
your wheels. Also, as you age it seems that there is a phenomenon called "anabolic resistance" which makes it harder for your body to utilize
protein, and larger dosing has been shown to be more effective for older men and women.

Q: I'm worried about getting too (bulky/skinny/whatever)
A: You won't - it takes consistent effort over a long period to notice these changes. And I guarantee you will have a more positive self-image
during the process, because you will feel better after doing this on a consistent basis.

Q: I can lift X lbs in the squat. Is that good?
A: How much you can lift is influenced by a lot of factors - your body build type, muscle insertions, age, training history, etc. So as such,
there is only one important comparison, which is with yourself. As long as you're striving to increase or maintain to your best ability,
the absolute number is not relevant at all.

1. Calories in, calories out still rules - nobody will ever gain weight on 500 calories a day, (almost) nobody will ever lose weight on 20k calories.
2. But hormone profiles, satiation, and psychological effects are important too, and can impact the partitioning of extra food. 
3. Remember, the goal is *not* to gain or lose weight per se. It is to maximize lean body mass and health, and minimize fat (to a reasonable point) and disease markers.


2. Everything is estimated off lean bodyweight, since that is the part of your body which predominantly 'metabolically active' (muscle, bone, organ).
